# Exposure to extremely partisan news from the other political side shows scarce boomerang effects

This repository contains the replication material of the article "Exposure to extremely partisan news from the other political side shows scarce boomerang effects", to be published at _Political Behavior_, by Andreu Casas, Ericka Menchen-Trevino, and Magdalena Wojcieszak.

## Data
The `./data/` directory contains the necessary data to replicate the analytical figures and tables of the paper. Below, we describe each of the datasets in this directory:

- `extreme-sites-experiment-maindb.csv`: pre and post survey data. The dataset also contains information about treatment compliance for those assigned to treatment. In the main directory of this repository you can find a codebook detailing each of the variables included in the dataset: [`extreme-sites-codebook.pdf`](https://github.com/CasAndreu/extreme_sites_scarce_boomerang/blob/main/extreme-sites-codebook.pdf).

- `extreme-sites-exp-browsing-data-toplot.csv`: browsing data for respondents in the treatment group. Contains information about how many times they accessed the extreme sites of the opposing ideology the days before, during, and after participating in the experiment.

- `robertson-fig2-sites-ideo-scores.csv`: ideology scores from Robertson et al. 2018, for the sites plotted in Fig.2.

- `extreme-sites-coded-visited-urls.csv`: self-reported and coded information about the URLs the participants in the treatment group visited during the experiment.


## Code
The `./code/` directory contains separate scripts to replicate each analytical figure in the article. The `./figures/` directory contains a copy of each of the figures generated by these scripts. 

- [`01-fig1b-browsing-data.R`](https://github.com/CasAndreu/extreme_sites_scarce_boomerang/blob/main/code/01-fig1b-browsing-data.R): replicates Figure 1b of the paper, in which we use the browsing  data we collected for some of the participants assigned to treatment to check whether on average they actually complied with the treatment.

- [`06-fig6-outlet-evaluations.R`](https://github.com/CasAndreu/extreme_sites_scarce_boomerang/blob/main/code/06-fig6-outlet-evaluations.R): to replicate Figure 6 of the paper, where we provide information about how respondents in the treatment group evaluated the extremes sites of the other ideology that they visited during the experiment.
